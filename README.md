# Claven

An intelligent Gmail labeling service that automatically categorizes incoming emails based on configurable rules.

## Features

- Monitors your Gmail inbox and applies labels based on rules defined in a YAML config
- **Known Sender Detection**: Label emails from people you've previously emailed
- **Content Matching**: Label emails where fields like `from`, `subject`, or `to` contain keywords
- **Multi-account support**: run against any number of accounts; each account's credentials and state are isolated under `accounts/<name>/`
- Efficiently polls for new messages using Gmail's history API (only processes changes, not the full inbox)
- Maintains a local cache of all addresses you've ever sent email to
- **Resumable scans**: both the inbox scan and sent recipients scan are checkpointed — interrupted scans resume exactly where they left off
- Both scans are interruptible with `Ctrl+C` and log progress every 10 messages with an accurate `i/total (pct%)` meter
- Sent recipients full scan fetches all message IDs upfront so the total is known before processing begins
- **Automatic reprocessing**: if the known senders list grows between runs, all inbox messages are automatically reprocessed so newly matching emails get labeled correctly

## Development

After cloning, run once to install dependencies and activate git hooks:

```bash
make setup
```

This installs `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`, and configures git to use the committed hooks in `.hooks/`. The pre-push hook runs the full test suite before every push — the push is aborted if any tests fail.

To run tests manually:

```bash
make test
```

### Running CI locally with `act`

`act` runs the GitHub Actions workflow locally inside Docker, injecting the same secrets CI uses. This is the recommended way to run the `e2e` and `live` test tiers.

**One-time setup:**

```bash
brew install act        # install act
# Start Docker Desktop
cp .secrets.example .secrets   # then fill in .secrets with real values
```

The real secret values are in [GitHub → Settings → Secrets](https://github.com/manubansal/claven/settings/secrets/actions). Fill in `.secrets` from there. `.secrets` is gitignored.

**Run:**

```bash
make ci       # runs the full CI test job locally
```

`act` spins up the Postgres service container, runs migrations, and executes the full pytest suite — including `e2e` and `live` tests — exactly as CI does.

### Testing

Tests are organized by layer:

| Marker | Command | Requires |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `unit` | `pytest -m unit` | nothing |
| `server` | `pytest -m server` | nothing |
| `integration` | `pytest -m integration` | `PYTEST_DATABASE_URL` |
| `e2e` | `pytest -m e2e` | `PYTEST_DATABASE_URL` + `TEST_GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN` + `TEST_GMAIL_EMAIL` |
| `live` | `pytest -m live` | all of the above + `PUBSUB_TOPIC` + `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` + `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; makes real Gmail API calls |

**`claven.test.inbox@gmail.com` is reserved exclusively for automated e2e tests.** Do not sign in with it manually or rely on any state it accumulates — the e2e fixture wipes and recreates this account in the DB on every run. Any manually-configured state for it will be destroyed the next time the e2e suite runs.

To re-obtain a refresh token for this account (e.g. after expiry), run:

```bash
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=... OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=... python scripts/get_test_token.py
```

Then update the `TEST_GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN` GitHub secret.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `credentials.json` in the repo root (one-time setup — see below)

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## One-Time App Setup

This only needs to be done once by whoever maintains the repo:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a project
2. Enable the **Gmail API**: APIs & Services > Enable APIs > search "Gmail API"
3. Create OAuth credentials: APIs & Services > Credentials > **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**
   - Application type: **Desktop app**
4. Download the credentials JSON and save it as `credentials.json` in the repo root

Commit `credentials.json` — it's the app's OAuth client identity and is safe to share.

## Adding a New Account

Just run the command — a browser window opens immediately for Gmail authorization:

```bash
python main.py --account personal
```

The OAuth token is saved as `accounts/<name>/token.json` and reused on subsequent runs.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py --account <name>
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--account NAME` | Account name to run as; state is stored under `accounts/<name>/` (required) |
| `--max-messages N` | Limit the initial inbox scan to N messages (useful for large inboxes or testing) |

**Example:**
```bash
python main.py --account personal
python main.py --account work --max-messages 500
```

The service polls continuously (default: every 60 seconds) and shuts down immediately and gracefully on `Ctrl+C` or `SIGTERM` — the polling sleep is interrupted instantly rather than waiting out the full interval.

Both the initial inbox scan and the sent recipients scan log progress every 10 messages and can be interrupted with `Ctrl+C` at any time — the checkpoint is saved and the next run resumes from where it left off.

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to define your polling interval and labeling rules:

```yaml
polling_interval_seconds: 60

labels:
  - name: "Known"
    rules:
      - field: "from"
        known_sender: true

  - name: "Newsletter"
    rules:
      - field: "subject"
        contains: ["newsletter", "unsubscribe", "weekly digest"]
```

### Rule Types

- **`known_sender: true`** — matches if the sender is in your sent recipients cache
- **`contains: [...]`** — matches if any keyword appears in the specified field (`from`, `subject`, `to`)

Multiple rules per label use **OR** logic — any matching rule will apply the label.
